# Etsy-Data-Analytics-Project-2022
This is a personal data analytics project looking into the data of my Etsy Store. **This is a work in progress! I will be adding details as I move along through the process.**
My Etsy store, Jessameseed Hand Embroidery, has been open since June 2020.  Using data from the past year (August 2021-July 2022), I will be looking for trends in various areas.

### ASK
##### Business Task: Are there any selling tends from the past few years and how can I expand on them or increase sales?

Some specific questions I will be asking are:
- Are there any trends related to time of year? Certain holidays?
- Are certain types of products more popular than others?
- What trends are seen when looking at the prices of items sold?

### PREPARE
I will be using monthly statements provided by Etsy as well as data that I have collected over the past year.
The data monthly statements focus on the finances of my shop, such as the item sold, how much it sold for, what fees and taxes are taken out of that sale, and net profit. I was less familiar with this data since I did not collect it myself.  

The data that I have collected focus on the products sold, such as product type, location of the sale, price, discount, and item name.

### PROCESS
After taking the time to look over what information was provided from Etsy, I began to clean the data.  This data didn't need much cleaning, I made sure that data types were consistent throughout, that there were no duplicates, and I checked spelling. I also added some totals at the bottom of several columns. For the "Type" column, I used the COUNTIF function to count the number of sales for that month, I also used the SUM function for the "Amount" column, "Fees and Taxes" column, and "Net" column.
